# Vapor_Edge_Motors⚡ Vapor Edge Motors — Website (First Draft)

🚀 Overview

This is my first working draft of the Vapor Edge Motors website — a futuristic electric motorbike brand concept.
The site includes multiple sections like Home, Models, Accessories, and Contact, built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and jQuery for basic interactivity.
This version focuses mainly on structure, layout, and styling — the JavaScript parts are not fully done yet.
